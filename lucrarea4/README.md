# Lucrarea 4 - Effective C++ Items 4, 5, 6

## Item 4: Make sure that objects are initialized before they're used

**Problem:** Uninitialized variables can lead to undefined behavior.

**Solution:** Always initialize member variables using initialization lists in constructors.

**Example in code:** The `Person` class demonstrates:
- Using initialization list (correct way)
- Order of initialization follows declaration order in class
- Built-in types are explicitly initialized

## Item 5: Know what functions C++ silently writes and calls

**Problem:** C++ automatically generates default constructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator, and destructor if you don't define them.

**Solution:** Be aware of these compiler-generated functions and their behavior.

**Example in code:** The `AutoGenerated` class shows:
- Compiler generates default constructor, copy constructor, copy assignment, and destructor
- The `ExplicitFunctions` class explicitly defines these functions
- Demonstrates when and how these functions are called

## Item 6: Explicitly disallow the use of compiler-generated functions you do not want

**Problem:** Sometimes you want to prevent copying or assignment of objects (e.g., singletons, resource managers).

**Solution:** 
- C++11 and later: Use `= delete` to explicitly delete unwanted functions
- Pre-C++11: Declare functions as private and don't implement them

**Example in code:** The `NoCopy` class demonstrates:
- Using `= delete` to prevent copying
- Compilation will fail if you try to copy instances of this class
